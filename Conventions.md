# Programming Conventions:

1. COMMENT CODE WITH JAVADOC!!
2. Camel Case for Functions, Pascal Case for Classes, Interfaces, etc.
3. Always pull to local repo before starting any work to try avoid conflicts
4. Always commit and push when finished with segment
5. Branch off from main for every new segment and push branch to repo so others can view changes and help where needed
6. Once branch complete, delete the branch
